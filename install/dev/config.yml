# The development config uses a few different paths to load files.
# There is also only one image dimension specified by default.

# This dev environment should be accessed via a separate virtualhost.
# An Apache example of such host configuration could be:
#
# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     DocumentRoot "<path_to_project>/dev"
#     ServerName dev.stitcher.local
#     ErrorLog "<log_path>/error.log"
#     CustomLog "<log_path>/access.log" common
#
#     <Directory "<path_to_project>/dev">
#         AllowOverride All
#         Require all granted
#     </Directory>
# </VirtualHost>

directories:
    # Use the same source directory as production
    src: ../src

    # Set the public directory to the current one.
    # HTML pages won't be rendered, but images will.
    public: ./

    #  Use the same cache directory as production
    cache: ../.cache

# Only create one image dimension
