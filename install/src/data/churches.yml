# An example of a YAML file with multiple entries (in this example: churches)

# A file containing multiple entries always needs the key "entries" as its root.
entries:

    # "church-a" would be the ID of the first entry.
    # Furthermore, this entry has some fields which can be used in any template.
    church-a:
        name: Church A
        description: This is a church with the name A
        # An advanced image field: the "src" variable will be parsed an generate multiple image sizes and a srcset.
        # Furthermore, an extra "alt" field is added to this image.
        image:
            src: /img/green.jpg
            alt: A green image
        # The value of this field is a path (starting with a "/" and ending in an extension.
        # This field will contain the parsed value of the related MarkDown file.
        body: /churches/church-a.md

    # The second entry with ID "church-b"
    church-b:
        name: Church B
        description: This is a church with the name B
        # A simpliefied image field will be parsed, but won't have any extra properties like "alt".
        image: /img/green.jpg
        body: /churches/church-b.md
