# Stitcher

A static site generator for PHP and Smarty, with a focus on high performance.

## TODO

- Smarty provider support
- Image provider support
- DI support for factories
- Dev controller

## What is it?

A static site generator using Smarty templates, and data providers for many formats, like YAML, JSON, MarkDown, SQLite, etc. 
Also providing helper functions to optimize the critical rendering path. Supporting responsive images, art direction, async asset loading, client type hinting, critical CSS loading, etc.
It's meant to be a prototyping tool in the first place, but who knows the possibilities?
